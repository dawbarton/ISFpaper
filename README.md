# Computer code to calculate Invariant Spectral Foliations

This code reproduces the figures of the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03655).

The two examples are
[Shaw-Pierre example](ShawPierre/README.md)
[Clamped-clamped beam example](CCbeam/README.md)

Note that the Clamped-clamped beam example takes a long time to run.  The
Shaw-Pierre example takes less time, but it is by no means fast. 
Optimisation consumes the most time, all other calculations are negligible
in comparison.
